## Overview

The challenge presented by the client involves developing an extension that allows for sending mass messages on the Skool platform. This task requires careful consideration of the platform's messaging capabilities and user interface to ensure seamless integration and user experience. Additionally, the extension must adhere to Skool's guidelines and regulations to maintain the platform's integrity and security. Meeting these requirements will be essential in successfully addressing the client's request and delivering a functional and user-friendly solution.

The Chrome extension injects code to the platform and communicates with the extension using the Message-passing to pass data across, it also modifies the XHR object to fetch the channel ID for sending messages.

## Technology Stack

- React for building the user interface of the Chrome extension.
- Zustand for state management, allowing for efficient data handling within the extension.
- Tailwind CSS for styling the extension, ensuring a modern and responsive design.
- Chrome Extension APIs for integrating with the browser and Skool platform.

## Outcome

The Skool Automation Extension successfully automates the process of sending messages on the Skool platform. It allows users to send mass messages efficiently while adhering to the platform's guidelines. The extension's user interface is intuitive, and it integrates seamlessly with the Skool platform, enhancing user experience.
