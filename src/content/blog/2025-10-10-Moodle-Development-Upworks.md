### Moodle Development

Today's blog is a short entry about re-entering the Moodle Development scene for income, and here's my rationale:

* Highly Niche and a lot of B2B sites are powered using Moodle
* I do possess a good understanding in SCORM, VLE and Articulate Storyline for authoring contents. 
* I do have the intention of integrating XR devices and Moodle to form an immersive learning experience.
* Plans for WebGL and AR are in the works. 

### Moodle Offers

* Training and Consulting
* Moodle 4.0 Theme and Plugin Development
* SCORM Authoring and Integration
* Moodle 4.0 Migration
* Moodle 4.0 Upgrade
* Moodle Installation
* Moodle API Integration and Mobile
* Possible future for Moodle mobile in Flutter or Native
