## Moodle Architecture Overview

Moodle is built on a **LAMP stack** (Linux, Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP), ensuring compatibility with a wide range of server environments. Its architecture follows a **modular, component-based design**, allowing developers to extend functionality through plugins, themes, and custom integrations. The system is designed to be scalable, secure, and maintainable, supporting institutions of varying sizes.

### Core Components of Moodle’s Architecture

1. **Presentation Layer (Front-End)**:
    - **Purpose**: Handles user interaction, rendering course content, and managing the user interface.
    - **Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP-based templates (Mustache).
    - **Key Features**:
        - **Themes**: Moodle’s theming system (based on Bootstrap) allows customization of the user interface. Themes like “Boost” and “Classic” are commonly used.
        - **Responsive Design**: Supports mobile and desktop access via responsive layouts.
        - **AJAX and JavaScript Frameworks**: YUI (Yahoo User Interface) and, in newer versions, modern JavaScript (e.g., AMD modules) enhance interactivity.

2. **Application Layer**:
    - **Purpose**: Manages the business logic, including user authentication, course management, and activity processing.
    - **Key Components**:
        - **Core Libraries**: Handle essential functions like user management, permissions, and data processing.
        - **Modules**: Moodle’s modular design allows for activities (e.g., quizzes, forums) and resources (e.g., files, URLs) to be added as plugins.
        - **Authentication and Enrolment**: Supports multiple authentication methods (e.g., LDAP, OAuth 2.0) and enrolment plugins (e.g., manual, self-enrolment).

3. **Data Layer**:
    - **Purpose**: Manages storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data.
    - **Database**: Typically MySQL or MariaDB, though PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MSSQL are supported.
    - **Schema**: Moodle uses a relational database with tables for users, courses, activities, grades, and more. The database abstraction layer (DML) ensures cross-database compatibility.
    - **File Storage**: Stores uploaded files (e.g., course materials) in a file system or cloud storage (via plugins).

4. **Plugin System**:
    - Moodle’s extensibility is driven by its **plugin architecture**, allowing developers to add custom functionality without modifying core code.
    - **Plugin Types**:
        - **Activity Modules**: Quizzes, forums, assignments, etc.
        - **Blocks**: Sidebar widgets for navigation or information.
        - **Authentication/Enrolment Plugins**: Extend user access methods.
        - **Themes**: Customize the look and feel.
        - **Reports and Filters**: Enhance analytics and content processing.

5. **Event and Logging System**:
    - Moodle’s **event-driven architecture** logs user actions (e.g., course access, quiz submissions) for analytics and reporting.
    - **Usage**: Events trigger actions in plugins or external systems via webhooks or API calls.

6. **Caching**:
    - Moodle uses **MUC (Moodle Universal Cache)** to improve performance by caching frequently accessed data (e.g., user sessions, course metadata).
    - **Supported Caches**: File-based, Memcached, Redis.

## Moodle APIs

Moodle provides a comprehensive set of APIs to enable integration with external systems, automate processes, and extend functionality. The primary APIs are the **Web Services API** and various **Internal APIs** for developers.

### 1. Web Services API

The **Web Services API** allows external applications (e.g., mobile apps, CRMs, or SIS) to interact with Moodle programmatically. It supports a wide range of operations, such as user management, course creation, and grade retrieval.

#### Key Features:
- **Protocols**: Supports REST, SOAP, XML-RPC, and JSON-based AJAX calls.
- **Authentication**: Uses tokens, OAuth 2.0, or manual authentication methods.
- **Core Functions**: Over 500 core functions (e.g., `core_user_create_users`, `core_course_get_courses`) for interacting with Moodle data.
- **Custom Functions**: Developers can create custom web services for specific needs.
- **Mobile App Integration**: The Moodle Mobile app leverages the Web Services API for seamless functionality.

#### Example Use Cases:
- **Student Information Systems (SIS)**: Sync user data, courses, and enrolments with systems like Banner or PeopleSoft.
- **Mobile Apps**: Enable course access, notifications, and submissions via the Moodle Mobile app.
- **Automation**: Automate course creation, user enrolment, or grade exports.

#### How to Use:
1. Enable web services in Moodle’s administration settings.
2. Create a service and assign functions (e.g., `core_course_get_contents`).
3. Generate an API token for a user or service account.
4. Make HTTP requests to the endpoint (e.g., `https://yourmoodle/webservice/rest/server.php`).

**Example REST Call** (Retrieve course list):
```bash
curl 'https://yourmoodle/webservice/rest/server.php?wstoken=your_token&wsfunction=core_course_get_courses&moodlewsrestformat=json'
```

**Response**:
```json
[
  {"id": 1, "fullname": "Introduction to Programming", "shortname": "CS101"},
  {"id": 2, "fullname": "Advanced Mathematics", "shortname": "MATH201"}
]
```

### 2. Internal APIs

Moodle’s **Internal APIs** are designed for developers building plugins or custom features within Moodle. These APIs provide access to Moodle’s core functionality and data structures.

#### Key Internal APIs:
- **Data Manipulation Layer (DML)**:
    - Provides database abstraction for querying and updating data.
    - Example: `$DB->get_records('course')` retrieves all courses.
- **Data Definition Layer (DDL)**:
    - Manages database schema changes (e.g., adding tables or columns for plugins).
- **Access Control API**:
    - Manages roles, capabilities, and permissions (e.g., `has_capability('mod/quiz:view', $context)`).
- **File API**:
    - Handles file uploads, storage, and retrieval (e.g., storing course materials or user submissions).
- **Form API**:
    - Simplifies creation of user input forms with validation (based on Moodle’s `moodleform` class).
- **Output API**:
    - Manages rendering of HTML, templates, and themes.
- **Event API**:
    - Allows plugins to react to events (e.g., user login, course completion) and trigger custom logic.

#### Example: Creating a Plugin with Internal APIs
To create a custom activity module that logs user interactions:
1. Use the **Event API** to listen for events like `course_viewed`.
2. Use the **DML API** to store interaction data in a custom table.
3. Use the **Output API** to render a custom interface for the activity.

**Sample Code** (Logging an event):
```php
$event = \core\event\course_viewed::create([
    'context' => context_course::instance($courseid),
    'userid' => $USER->id
]);
$event->trigger();
```

### 3. External Database and Authentication APIs
- **External Database Authentication/Enrolment**: Connects Moodle to external databases for user authentication or course enrolment.
- **LDAP Integration**: Syncs user data with LDAP servers.
- **OAuth 2.0**: Supports single sign-on (SSO) with providers like Google, Microsoft, or custom OAuth servers.

### 4. Reporting API
- Moodle’s **Reporting API** enables custom report generation for administrators and teachers.
- Example: Generate a report of user activity using the `reportbuilder` plugin or custom SQL queries.

### 5. IMS LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability)
- Moodle supports **LTI** as both a provider and consumer, allowing integration with external tools (e.g., Zoom, Turnitin).
- **Use Case**: Embed an external quiz tool in a Moodle course.

## Security and Scalability Considerations

### Security:
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Fine-grained permissions ensure users only access authorized resources.
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in tokens prevent cross-site request forgery.
- **API Tokens**: Secure web services with token-based authentication.
- **Data Validation**: Moodle sanitizes inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

### Scalability:
- **Caching**: MUC reduces database load for large installations.
- **Load Balancing**: Moodle supports multi-server setups with load balancers.
- **Database Optimization**: Indexes and query optimization improve performance for large user bases.
