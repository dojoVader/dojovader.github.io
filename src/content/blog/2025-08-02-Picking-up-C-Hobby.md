### Introduction

In this article, I decided to take my imposter syndrome head-on and learn C programming language. I have always been a Java and Node developer, but I realized that understanding C is crucial for mastering data structures and algorithms (DSA). C is a low-level language that provides a better understanding of how computers work, making it an excellent choice for learning DSA. So this note is going to focus on picking C for learning DSA and not going into deep, and I will be sharing my experience with build tools and compiling C code. Ideally Java is a great fit, because it helps when creating complex Data structures from scratch, however C has enough feature to create complex structures through the use of structs and pointers.
