## Preface

This is a brief introduction to MathJax, MathJax helps render mathematical expressions on the browser using SVG/CSS. I am currently studying the "Discrete Mathematics and Applications" by Kenneth Rosen. The goal is to create study notes and rendering the Mathematical notations.



### What does MathJax look like

The mathematics powered by [**MathJax**](https://www.mathjax.org/):

$$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{6} $$


When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are

$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$



Fin.
