## Chrome Extension and Monitoring XHR ( XMLHttpRequest )

> The concept behind the XMLHttpRequest object was originally created by the developers of Outlook Web Access (by Microsoft) for Microsoft Exchange Server 2000.[4] An interface called IXMLHTTPRequest was developed and implemented into the second version of the MSXML library using this concept.[4][5] The second version of the MSXML library was shipped with Internet Explorer 5.0 in March 1999, allowing access, via ActiveX, to the IXMLHTTPRequest interface using the XMLHTTP wrapper of the MSXML library.[6]

Internet Explorer versions 5 and 6 did not define the XMLHttpRequest object identifier in their scripting languages as the XMLHttpRequest identifier itself was not standard at the time of their releases.[6] Backward compatibility can be achieved through object detection if the XMLHttpRequest identifier does not exist.[7] Microsoft added the XMLHttpRequest object identifier to its scripting languages in Internet Explorer 7.0 released in October 2006.[6]

The Mozilla project developed and implemented an interface called nsIXMLHttpRequest into the Gecko layout engine. This interface was modeled to work as closely to Microsoft's IXMLHTTPRequest interface as possible.[8][9] Mozilla created a wrapper to use this interface through a JavaScript object which they called XMLHttpRequest.[10] The XMLHttpRequest object was accessible as early as Gecko version 0.6 released on December 6, 2000,[11][12] but it was not completely functional until as late as version 1.0 of Gecko released on June 5, 2002.[11][12] The XMLHttpRequest object became a de facto standard in other major web clients, implemented in Safari 1.2 released in February 2004,[13] Konqueror, Opera 8.0 released in April 2005,[14] and iCab 3.0b352 released in September 2005.[15]

With the advent of cross-browser JavaScript libraries such as jQuery, developers can invoke XMLHttpRequest functionality indirectly.
