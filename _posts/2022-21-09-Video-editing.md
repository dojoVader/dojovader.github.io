I decided to pick up a hobby, Technical Content-Creator ; what does this mean?

It simply means creating content around Technology, programming, gaming and interesting computer architecture details.

#### Technical Background
Luckily, I won’t exactly call myself a newbie, I took part in the community of encoding and compressing video contents, after I researched how the anime community organize and distribute content.

My research eventually led me to Doom 9; a forum for video encoders and production enthusiasts.

#### Codecs / Avisynth and VirtualDub
Doom 9 showed me how to compress videos, codecs/ de-muxer/ 1st pass & 2nd Pass, the bitrate settings and what they meant. As I got deeper, I eventually found out about Video Frame-servers.

` “Frameserving is a process by which you directly transfer video data from one program on your computer to another. No intermediate or temporary files are created. The program that opens the source file(s) and outputs the video data is called the frame server. The program that receives the data could be any type of video application.`

#### Current Workflow and tools
##### Stage 1: Recording and Muxing
* Linux Machine

* OBS Studio

* Avidemux

* Avxsynth ( Linux port of Avisynth)

* FFmpeg (Multimedia framework for mux, demux, encode and transcode)

#### Stage 2: Post-processing and final touches
* Windows Machine

* Adobe Premiere

* Adobe After Effects
Note: I use the Windows Machine for the final post-processing because of 2 reasons:
Nvidia GPU and NVEncoder (This allows Premiere and After Effects to offload the workload to the GPU.  an 8GB 1080 Nvidia Card)

* Adobe Premiere and MisterHorse Plugins.
