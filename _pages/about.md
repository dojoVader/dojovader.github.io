## About me

With 10+ years of experience in front-end development and a strong background in core JavaScript and the DOM API, I am a senior front-end engineer who delivers high-quality web applications and solutions for enterprise and e-commerce clients. I have an advanced diploma in software engineering, a bachelor's degree in information technology and business information system, and certifications in Lean Six Sigma and Microsoft .NET Framework 4.

Currently, I support OLI Systems with the development of its portal and solution on the cloud, using Angular, Svelte, and TypeScript as my main tools. I also work for various Andela partners as a contractor, where I integrate and collaborate with existing teams on different projects and platforms. Additionally, I develop Chrome extensions and Shopify stores for various clients on Upwork where I retain the status of a Top rated freelancer, leveraging my skills and expertise in e-commerce and web development. My mission is to create user-friendly, responsive, and scalable web applications that meet the needs and expectations of my clients and users.
